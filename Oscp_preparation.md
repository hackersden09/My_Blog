# OSCP Preparation By Suraj Waghmare

ü§ó **Remember the regrets of the 100-year-olds. Work hard, stay focused, but quit at a reasonable time. Spend time with friends and family today, go outside, and don't skip your workout .**


*   Notes : This is not the official path for OSCP preparation. We have gathered some resources to create this dashboard. By enrolling in OSCP, you can start with the course materials. If you don't have course materials, you can use resources shared in Course Materials tab, just click on topic name

> You can change stages as per your understanding. You you want you can first go for htb and then official material or vice versa.

## ‚úÖ Stage 1 Study Hard

**NEW: The 10 PWK lab machines reported on must include Active Directory targets. Offsec decided to give 10 bonus points for lab report so I will insist to create lab report.** 

Requires completion of at least **10** PWK lab machines along with a detailed report, including all of the PWK course exercise solutions for a total value of **10 Bonus Points**.

I found this blog helpful to understand active directory

## ‚úí Stage 2 - TJ Null htb ( Can be skipped if you have done 50+ htb boxes)

[IppSec - Search](https://ippsec.rocks/?#)

You can do this stage after completing course material but you will loose your lab time. Better you start it before lab or after completing your lab.

If you think machines from hack the box are difficult to crack, you can start with virtual hacking labs. They have great lab to start with.  As offsec has decided to reduce bof marks to 10 I have not included separate tracker for that. You can use tryhackme room if you feel **unprepared.**

## ‚ùÇ Stage 3 Pre-Exam

If you have done 50+ boxes from htb and 50+ boxes from offsec lab you can skip this part. But **I will recommend to do it.**
